<h1>Overview</h1>
<p> I want to start this report off by saying that, I am going into this blind as it is my first vulnerability assesssment I am performing. I only have theoretical knowledge on this topic. I asm going to be setting up a virtualized network attempting to simulate a small-to-medium business's network. I will document and report the general blueprint of the network and provide visuals along the way. I believe I will be using OpenVAS for vulnerability scanning, and remediation. Additionally, The overall report and the actual remediation, patching, etc. will be documented in a seperate document. This will be strictly a report based around a scenario where I was to perform a consultation as a third-party. I believe I will in the future doing some risk assessments, some compliancy audits as well as some physical security audits using real world businesses as examples. I digress, This document will strictly be the report and then I will outline and document the fixes, remediation, etc. in another document.</p>
<h4>Update</h4>
<p>With the limited resources I have at the moment, I decided to actually start smaller, for this exercise I am going to be focusing on one end point device on a hypothetical network, I realized my scope was too big to begin with 
for the amount of money and hardware I personally own. I will revisit this larger scope in a lab later down the road, perhaps after I get some more money and access to resources to set it up as I want without hardware limitations. </p>

<h1>Structure</h1>
<p>I believe structuring this report into six sections makes the most logical sense, they go as followed: </p>
<p>1. Executive Summary</p>
<p>2. Scan Results</p>
<p>3. Methodology</p>
<p>4. Findings</p>
<p>5. Risk Assessment</p>
<p>6. Recommendations</p>

<h1>Executive Summary</h1>
<p>The dates that this vulnerability assessment has taken place, Start:<b>07/23/24</b> to End:<b>07/25/24</b></p>
<p><b>Scope of this assessment:</b> The scope of this assessment is restricted to the one theoretical user end point device, I have downloaded the  Corrosion.ova vm file off of vulhub for this exercise which will be the vulnerable system used in this assessment</p>
<p>General status of the assessment and summary of your findings regarding risk to the client</p>
