<h1>Overview</h1>
<p> I want to start this report off by saying that, I am going into this blind as it is my first vulnerability assesssment I am performing. I only have theoretical knowledge on this topic. I asm going to be setting up a virtualized network attempting to simulate a small-to-medium business's network. I will document and report the general blueprint of the network and provide visuals along the way. I believe I will be using Qualys for vulnerability scanning, and remediation. Additionally, The overall report and the actual remediation, patching, etc. will be documented in a seperate document. This will be strictly a report based around a scenario where I was to perform a consultation as a third-party. I believe I will in the future doing some risk assessments, some compliancy audits as well as some physical security audits using real world businesses as examples. I digress, This document will strictly be the report and then I will outline and document the fixes, remediation, etc. in another document.</p>
<h4>Update</h4>
<p>With the limited resources I have at the moment, I decided to actually start smaller, for this exercise I am going to be focusing on one end point device on a hypothetical network, I realized my scope was too big to begin with 
for the amount of money and hardware I personally own. I will revisit this larger scope in a lab later down the road, perhaps after I get some more money and access to resources to set it up as I want without hardware limitations. </p>

<h1>Structure</h1>
<p>I believe structuring this report into six sections makes the most logical sense, they go as followed: </p>
<p>1. Executive Summary</p>
<p>2. Scan Results</p>
<p>3. Methodology</p>
<p>4. Findings</p>
<p>5. Risk Assessment</p>
<p>6. Recommendations</p>

<h1>Executive Summary</h1>
<p>The dates that this vulnerability assessment has taken place, Start:<b>07/29/24</b> to End:<b>07/29/24</b></p>
<p><b>Scope of this assessment:</b> The scope of this assessment is restricted to the one theoretical user end point device, I have downloaded the  jangow01.ova vm file off of vulhub for this exercise which will be the vulnerable system used in this assessment</p> 
<p>The assessment has been concluded; futhermore, overall risk for the client is categorized as severe upon completion of the assessment if I had to provide a rating out of 10 the risk this system poses is a 10/10</p>
<p>Disclaimer</p>

<h1>Scan Results</h1>

<p>Screen capture of the Vulnerability Scans results for the jangow01 virtual machine</p>

<p>Results can be broken down into two categories.</p>
<p>1. Confirmed Vulnerabilities<br><br>
There are four such vulnerabilities confirmed on this machine, two of which are of primary concern<br>
<b>a.FTP not requiring encrypted credentials</b>. i.e. plaintext(unencrypted) data in transit is susceptible to MitM, Sniffing, Replay attacks, and Tampering, this threatens both integrity and confidentiality, ultimitely utilizing secure protocols which have strong industry standard encryption is pivitol, I recommend ECC-384bit or minimum RSA-4096bit for data encryption.<br><br>
Additionally, remediation for this vulnerability can be addressed through switching from FTP to SFTP, the secure file transfer protocol.<br><br>
<b>b.No HTTP Security Header absense of X-Content-Type-Options:nosniffer && HSTS</b><br>
Qualys only lists this vulnerability as a 2/5, but I believe it should be rated higher as a vulnerability since the absense of HSTS means that all requests between client and server will be conducted through http rather then https, this means that all communication is unencrypted, and susceptible to a lot of the same things as the FTP server is as previously stated.<br><br>
Additionally, the lack of the X-Content-Type header which is meant to prevent MIME type sniffing, means that this system could be vulnerable to MIME type confusion leading to XSS and remote code execution. </p>

<p>2. Potential Vulnerabilities</p>
<p>There are 20 Potential Vulnerabilities identified within the scan, I believe that most if not all of them are legitimate vulnerabilities to this system. Why? Looking at the version of Apache that the clients machine runs on, it is severely outdated, (Apache2.4.18), according to the date 07/17/24, Apache2.4.62 is the latest. Many of these vulnerabilities leave possibility for remote code execution, denial of service and in general compromising the safety of the CIA triade in regards to the data contained in the Apache server.</p>

<h1>Methodology</h1>
<p>The methodology of this assessment can be divided into two stages<br><br>
1. Qualys Cloud-based vulnerability scan<br>
a. analysis and intepretation of the scan<br>
2. Transferring the enumeration of information from the vulnerability scan into a Web Application-Based Penetration Test<br>
a. This was undertaken with the predominate use of Burp-Suite as the main tool utilized to poke-and-prod around the Apache server<br>
