<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>In this file,  I am simply documenting how I created the vulnerable network that is to be used for the vulnerability and risk assessment. I am not going to make it extremely complex as I have limited resources
and my goal is to learn and simulate the real deal for educational experience. My goal is not to solve an extremely complex problem. Grasping the fundamentals, proving that I have the compentancy to perform these kinds of assessments is my main goal.
The concepts are the same no matter what kind of scope, therefor this virtual network is not going to be anything crazy, I will do my best to emulate a smaller-medium sized business's network</p>

<h1>Network Topology</h1>
<h4>Platform</h4>
<p>I am choosing to use Microsoft Azure as a platform to host and utilize their resources for the creation of this network 
It is the most efficient and easiest implementation that came to mind for my current situation</p>
<h4>Design</h4>
<p>I have done some research on what small to medium business networks general look like, many forums and websites have mentioned how a lot of them are dumpster fires with multiple single points of failure within the topology. In this exercise I actually want
to do my due dilligence and design a neatly organized, redundant network that can withstand a bit more, following generally accepted best practices within the industry as a means to really learn and reinforce good habits.</p>
